# Contributing to SoftPrompt-IR

SoftPrompt-IR is an experimental concept, not a framework or product.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- conceptual discussions
- examples and counterexamples
- minimal clarifications
- failure cases

Please avoid:
- adding execution logic
- turning this into a DSL or workflow system
- overengineering or abstraction for its own sake

Open an issue to discuss ideas before proposing changes.
