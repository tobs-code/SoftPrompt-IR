# Contributing to SoftPrompt-IR (Research / Evaluation)

SoftPrompt-IR is an experimental annotation concept for prompt intent and weighting.

Contributions are welcome that focus on:
- empirical comparisons (before / after)
- small-scale evaluations or ablations
- controlled examples and counterexamples
- failure modes and edge cases

Please keep changes minimal and well-scoped.
Prefer observation over prescription.

This project does not aim to define execution semantics or guarantees.
If you propose an extension, explain what ambiguity it reduces.
